  - 💬 I am 22 years old, currently living in Brazil. I have intermediate in English and have experience with create basic API's, Login register, Data Analisys.
      - I started my studies during the Pandemic in 2021, where I had my first contact with the area of programming. Nowadays, I'm looking for new ways to improve the way I study programming and where I can apply them.
    
  - ⚡I really like playing fps and RPG games; practice physical activities, such as gym and muai thai; traveling would be my first hobby if I had the money XD and I love studying while listening to lofi music. I'm sure this helps a lot to identify who Herick is.
    
      - Good interpersonal and team communication, developed during projects delivered in college subjects;
      - Ability to adapt, learn quickly  and resilient in dynamic environments learned during the group project on logical reasoning;
      - A person who was always positive and had a lot of empathy, he owed the volunteer work done within Seicho-no-ie;
      - Always helping people when he has knowledge on the subject, developed during the 1st semester at college until the 3rd semester (where I am currently).
